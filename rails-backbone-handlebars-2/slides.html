          <p>You've written many Todo apps in your days of learning various Javascript frameworks, but what happens when you select
            a framework, sit down, and start implementing your masterpiece App of the Future? You very quickly run into things that aren't
            covered in the Todo App tutorial.</p>

          <p>This talk focuses on getting from the tutorial to a working application.  It includes tips on rubygems and javascript libraries
            you can use, as well as tips on designing your application from scratch.  It also has a very special appearance by the Handlebars
            template library.</p>
