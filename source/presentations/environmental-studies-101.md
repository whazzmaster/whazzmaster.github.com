Some of the most productive tools I've ever learned about I encountered just by happening to look over someone's shoulder
at the right time. At the February [Mad-Railer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Mad-Railers/) I gave this talk about some
helpful recent gems and libraries that I was using in my rails apps that I really liked.

*Note*: When I wrote up this talk the [Honeybadger](http://honeybadger.io) service for tracking exceptions was in a free
beta. It's now out of beta and no longer free, but it does do its job really well.
