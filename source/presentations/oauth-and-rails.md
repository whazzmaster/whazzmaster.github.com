In this talk my goal was to start with a Rails 3.2 application with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) installed and configured, and then show how easy it was to add OAuth login support using the [omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) gem ecosystem.

In addition to the slides, the application I extended is available on GitHub. Clone the repo at [whazzmaster/omniauth-on-rails](https://github.com/whazzmaster/omniauth-on-rails) and you can work through the steps I took during the talk to try it for yourself.
