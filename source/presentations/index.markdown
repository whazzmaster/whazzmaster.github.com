  This talk introduces some solutions to challenges that surface when you start digging
  just beneath the surface of Todo applications using Backbone.js and Rails.  I discuss some
  gems and javascript libraries that make bootstrapping apps easier, help with model
  relationships, and end with some tips on getting started with Backbone.

  This talk discusses some Rails-related gems and tools I was using in Winter 2013
  that I felt were huge productivity boosts. The slides discuss a variety of different
  developer-focused enhancements that make debugging and logging easier, along with
  a UI enhancement library thrown in for good measure because I loved how configurable
  it was.
