title: Fitgem v0.4.0
---
I'm happy to announce that the [latest Fitbit API features](http://groups.google.com/group/fitbit-api/browse_thread/thread/3144a7299b60fa16) have been exposed through the fitgem ruby library and released as v0.4.0. 

In addition to the new features, I thoroughly documented the entire library API ([available here](http://rubydoc.info/github/whazzmaster/fitgem/master/frames)), added many more unit tests, refactored the subscriptions methods, and moved the oauth process documentation to the [project wiki on github](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem/wiki/The-OAuth-Process).

### v0.4.0 changelog

* Added YARD documentation to thoroughly document code
* DEPRECATED: <tt>Fitgem::Client#log_weight</tt> method, use <tt>Fitgem::Client#log_body_measurements</tt> instead.  
  The new method allows you to log more than weight (bicep size, body fat %, etc.)
* Added <tt>Fitgem::FoodFormType</tt> to be used in calls to <tt>Fitgem::Client#create_food</tt>
* Added <tt>Fitgem::Client#log_sleep</tt> to log sleep data to fitbit
* Added <tt>Fitgem::Client#delete_sleep_log</tt> to delete previously logged sleep data
* Added <tt>Fitgem::Client#activities</tt> method to get a list of all activities
* Added <tt>Fitgem::Client#activity_statistics</tt> method to get statistics for all logged activities
* Added to documentation of supported endpoints for <tt>Fitgem::Client#data_by_time_range</tt>
* Added unit tests for parameter validation for many methods
* Overhauled notifications methods, including extensive documentation,
  unit tests, refactoring, and a couple of bug fixes.  These methods now
  return both the HTTP status code and the JSON response body.  See https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/API/Subscriptions-API
  for information on how to interpret each of the error codes.
* Added fitgem to travis-ci for continuous integration (http://travis-ci.org/#!/whazzmaster/fitgem)
* Added fitgem to rubydoc.info (http://rubydoc.info/github/whazzmaster/fitgem/master/frames)
* Updated README
* Moved OAuth documentation from the README to the [fitgem wiki](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem/wiki/The-OAuth-Process)
