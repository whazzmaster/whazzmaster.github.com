I'm happy to announce that the [latest Fitbit API features](http://groups.google.com/group/fitbit-api/browse_thread/thread/8e8aed16706642d6#) have been exposed through the fitgem ruby library and released as v0.5.0. 

New features include glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate logging and retrieval methods.   Documentation has also been updated to include new endpoints for the Time Series interface.
