The best thing to do when you're comfortable and successful (on a job, in a code base, on a project) is jerk the wheel hard to the left and drive off a cliff.

I've worked for [Intuit](http://www.intuit.com) for over a decade now, and most of that time is in the [Payroll group](http://payroll.intuit.com). I've worked on many code bases in pursuit of Dem Payroll Dollahs, but the most challenging has always been the QuickBooks (Windows) desktop code.

You must understand that nothing that follows is a jape at the hundreds of developers that have worked on QuickBooks over the years- I would feel very bad if any of them wree to read this and think I was dogging them or their code.  The simple fact is that working with QuickBooks is _challenging_; much like anyone developing on top of a code base that is more than 20 years old.  The challenging nature is due partly to the age and partly to the success of the product.

The Age and the Success are intertwined in a way that makes it difficult to take umbrage at the complex (*cough* spa)ghetti *cough*) nature of the code, and it took me a long time to realize that.  For a product that lived much of its two-decade life commanding 85%+ market share in its category (and continues such to this day) QuickBooks actually has a decent deployment-level architecture.  Dozens of engineers have established incredibly helpful and clean subsystems over the years, and as much as I go on Twitter and swear about 1992-era struct/class hybridization I also occasionally pale at creating greenfield codebases without the extensive logging, etc. support.
