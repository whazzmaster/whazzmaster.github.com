  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It all started with a <a href="http://whazzing.com/blog/2012/03/20/becoming-the-finisher/#comment-743146618">comment</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem-client/pull/4">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t put time into maintaining my <a href="http://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem">fitbit gem</a> <a href="http://www.fitbitclient.com">reference app</a> in quite awhile, and when I got a pull request to update it to the latest rails version I at first hesitated. After talking with some folks at <a href="http://www.bendyworks.com">my coworking space</a>, however, I decided to use some holiday downtime to pull in the changes and see if I could build on them to improve the quality of the site.</p>

<p>At first I was horrified to learn that I&#8217;d stopped in mid-refactoring, and I realized it was no wonder that Marcel (the submitter) reported he&#8217;d had trouble getting certain tests to run. The first step was to delete whole directories of files and tests that no longer conformed to the current design of the site and ensure that the files that remained all contributed to that current design.</p>

<p>I pulled down Marcel&#8217;s pull request and got to work merging it in, at which point I looked at the login code and got embarrassed again. The truth is, the <a href="http://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem">fitgem</a> library wasn&#8217;t really built for managing oauth logins; instead it optimized for using a token/secret for a given user to fetch data from the API. Yes, you could use fitgem to facilitate an oauth login process, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t built with rails in mind and you had to roll your own controllers, views, and token and secret management.</p>

<p>We already have a library that does that sort of thing: <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a> is a fantastic library for consuming <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">pluggable login strategies</a>. I didn&#8217;t have to search long before I found a <a href="https://github.com/tkgospodinov/omniauth-fitbit">fitbit strategy for omniauth</a>, and I set to work integrating it into the reference app.</p>

<p>Luckily I had been working a lot with OmniAuth lately, as I&#8217;d implemented logins via Facebook and Twitter in another project just the week before. As always I leaned heavily on Ryan Bates&#8217; excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> in getting up to speed on how <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/235-devise-and-omniauth-revised">OmniAuth worked with Devise</a>, and specifically with Twitter and <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/360-facebook-authentication">Facebook</a>. &lt;small-plus&gt;Railscasts Pro ($9/month) has been totally worth it for me. The Pro episodes go into a lot of depth and I&#8217;ve learned a ton from them.&lt;/small-plug&gt;</p>

<p>Using the omniauth-fitbit gem I was able to delete a lot of now-redundant code for signing into/up for the application. There were, however, a few hiccups along the way that I wanted to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlike Twitter and Facebook, logging into Fitbit via omniauth-fitbit doesn&#8217;t allow devise to remember you from session to session, so you end having to re-login every time. I haven&#8217;t yet figured out why, but it may be something about how Fitbit conducts OAuth logins or it may be a configuration issue with omniauth-fitbit.</li>
<li>Logging in via Fitbit is fine and dandy, but if you want to use the token/secret for the logged-in user to fetch data from the API through the fitgem interface you&#8217;ll need to store them. I just added fields to my user object:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I made some, ahem, unorthodox decisions that will have to refactored later. Chief among them was to add the FitbitClient to the User model:</li>

<p>Eventually we should use a better pattern for this, but for now it&#8217;s simplistic and anywhere you have a logged-in user in your application you will be able to call <code>fitbit_data</code> to get access to a configured FitbitClient instance.</p>

<p>And with that we&#8217;re logging in via Fitbit and using the token/secret returned via omniuath-fitbit to fuel data retrieval from the Fitbit API through fitgem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m trying <strong>really</strong> hard to not read Hacker News these days, as the contrarian argument-for-argument&#8217;s-sake nature of the comments tends to enrage me, but one of the more mystifying memes that seems to persist down in the Comments Dungeon is that the social contract of the United States of America requires you to be on Facebook.</p>

<p>In each thread where the topic appears there&#8217;s someone that says &#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t have to have a Facebook account but unfortunately it&#8217;s required.&#8221;  Someone responds and notes that no, <strong>it&#8217;s not required</strong>, and all they have to do is delete their account.  That (sensible) response is then responded to a million times with the now-ubiquitous oath: to be a fully-fledged member of a social group in 2012 requires one to be on Facebook.  And to that I restate the obvious: no, it really isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>How many devices do you use on a daily basis? Phones, laptops, tablets, desktops, kiosks, and more.  There exists a whole world outside of Facebook and all you have to do is grasp it.  I prefer phone calls or coffee with friends over email but it&#8217;ll do in a pinch.  I share my photos through Flickr and Twitter (depending on whether they came from my DSLR or iPhone).  I blog at a skrillion different venues.  People know where to find me online and IRL, and I&#8217;m confident that within my social circle I won&#8217;t be left off some invite just because I&#8217;m not on Facebook.  My friends are my friends&#8211; we enjoy each others&#8217; company!  What I found when I deleted my Facebook account was that none of my friends really used it for anything meaningful.  My wall was eternally filled with high school people I hadn&#8217;t seen/talked to/cared about in a decade, and extended family that I didn&#8217;t talk to much anyways.</p>

<p>In the last 5 years I&#8217;ve taken two significant (though very First-World-Problemy) steps: I got rid of my car, and I deleted my Facebook account.  Interestingly enough <strong>at the time I did each of these things</strong> I was much more uncomfortable and worried about having no car than that I would miss some crucial social interaction by leaving Facebook.</p>

<p>When I left Facebook there was much more a sense of relief than anything else; <strong>I suggest you try it</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Please note</em>: Madison Ruby photos are now online at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whazzmaster/sets/72157631263044942/">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whazzmaster/7869056820/"><img class="right" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7869056820_aacfe79e4b_n.jpg" width="320" height="213" title="Greg Tarnoff at Madison Ruby 2012" ></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m working off the conference hangover. Email catchup, priotizing
tasks, etc. took up my time this morning, but I couldn&#8217;t let Madison&#8217;s
premier software conference fade without writing down some thoughts.</p>

<p>Firstly: much love to Jim and Jen Remsik as well as all the volunteers,
speakers, and organizers that helped make v2 of Madison Ruby even more
fun and entertaining than the inaugural conf last year. The diversity
of topics was again front and center: from team
dynamics, to talks about social justice, to funky drummers, to sources
of inspiration and the finer points of immigration law, the organizers
found a way to communicate technical content while advancing the
community in other areas as well.</p>

<p>First up was the <a href="http://madisonruby2012.sched.org/event/45828a0ad9ccd45642acbeeefabd9aa1">Design Eye for the Dev Guy or Gal</a> workshop on Thursday.  I misunderstood the focus, which is mostly because I signed up for it before a comprehensive description had been published.  <a href="https://twitter.com/pengwynn">Wynn Netherland</a> did a great job laying out the finer points of HTML5, Sass, Compass, and more.  I had expected the workshop to range more towards the philosophy of web design, rather than a technical how-to around using the tools.  Even so, however, I learned a lot about Compass.  My previous aversion stemmed from when compass and blueprint were sold as a boxed set, but I&#8217;m definitely going to check it out on the next major project.</p>

<p>Highlight: In a discussion about the ubiquity of Twitter Bootstrap Wynn
asked how many folks were using Octopress for their dev blog, and then
added, &#8220;You know, you don&#8217;t HAVE to use the default style&#8230; you can add
some color in there.&#8221; <em>sheepish grin</em></p>

<p>I may have had a little too much fun at the Github-sponsored drinkup on
Thursday evening; waking up and riding my bike downtown at 7am was a
monumental task.</p>

<p>Friday&#8217;s talks were very interesting, especially the <a href="http://madisonruby2012.sched.org/event/b50ba5ffa1585b870253b928b153d74f"><strong>Anti-Opression 101</strong></a>
talk by Lindsey Bieda and Steve Klabnik.  Though I had seen it a
previous <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Mad-Railers/">Mad-Railers meetup</a> I also enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/rathboma">Matthew Rathbone</a>&#8217;s talk
about how <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> uses <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> for its various data processing needs. Unfortunately, I had to take off early on Friday and missed some of the afternoon talks, including what I heard was a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=clyde+%23madisonruby&amp;src=typd">fantastic 45 minutes</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Stubblefield">Clyde Stubblefield</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday I was feeling a lot better, and hit the Farmer&#8217;s Market early
for coffee and pastries.  I&#8217;m embarassed to say that I hadn&#8217;t looked
at the schedule closely enough and so it was an extremely pleasant surprise
that the first talk was by Paolo Perrotta,  author of the best Ruby book
in existence: <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby">Metaprogramming Ruby</a>.
It was a great talk about ghosts, fake ghosts, and all manner of
potential problems one will encounter when using the metaprogramming
aspect of the Ruby language.</p>

<p>Later in the day were several successive talks that excited the hell out
of me, but none moreso than <a href="https://twitter.com/rubybuddha">Leon Gersing</a>&#8217;s talk
on the Weird in programming.  Difficult to describe so I&#8217;ll just say
that if he&#8217;s speaking at a conference make sure you get your ass to that
talk and be prepared to enjoy it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Teaching Rails</strong> panel discussion late in the day on Saturday was
interesting.  I almost didn&#8217;t attend because I thought it was going to
be about how best to teach Rails to new folks.  Instead it was more
about the <em>business</em> of teaching Rails and how each of the four
panelists approached it.  Ultimately the panel dovetailed into a talk
about certification, payscales, and other highly interesting topics to
any software developer.  I felt that <a href="https://twitter.com/j3">Jeff Casimir</a>&#8217;s innocent
suggestion of some kind of certification was not considered for a single
second before being shouted down by everyone else on the panel and in
attendance.  In particular, I think his idea has merit but the operational reality is
bad, which is why everyone just said &#8220;NO CERTIFICATION&#8221; when I think
what is needed is a
discussion about what certification is trying to accomplish and how it
can be done without turning into a paradise for grifters and dummies.</p>

<p>This was just a taste of the goings-on at Madison Ruby 2012. Others will
likely have a fuller rundown of the events so I just hit what were, to
me, the highlights.  If you&#8217;re down on the Ruby tip I highly suggest you
try to get to Madison for next year&#8217;s conference.  You can already hit
the <a href="http://2013.madisonruby.org/">Very Early Bird registration page</a> and get a ticket for the low,
low price of $199.  Do it, and come hang out with me next year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time I was in Vegas with some friends. Over the course of 72
hours myself and half a dozen friends drifted in and out of our hotel
room at different times of the day and night as we gambled and boozed
our way across the landscape.</p>

<p>At around 3am one friend drunkenly burst into the hotel room and started
going on and on about how great he was doing, gambling-wise.  He talked
at length even as it became obvious that he was winding down like some
kind of strange children&#8217;s toy.  Then he surged out of bed and said, &#8220;I
have an idea!&#8221;  Another friend asked what it was and got the classic
response, &#8220;I&#8217;ll need $300 of your money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then what?&#8221; asked the friend, genuinely intrigued.</p>

<p>Alas, friend one was already passed out.  When asked the next morning
what the great $300 was he had no idea what we were talking about.</p>

<p>I think about this story every time I see a vaguely defined,
ill-conceived <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter campaign</a> that
will ultimately result in a fugue state where everyone wonders what
happened to their money in the morning.</p>

<p>(Note: this is not a jab at Kickstarter itself; I think there&#8217;s some
great stuff going on there.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Via <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3728664">Hacker News</a> this morning I read Jacques Mattheij&#8217;s <a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/The+Starter+the+Architect+the+Debugger+and+the+Finisher">The Starter, the Architect, the Debugger and the Finisher</a>.  It was a great topic and one that I think about often; for me personally <strong>finishing projects smoothly is my biggest challenge</strong>.</p>

<p>For me, starting projects is a great time to be alive.  I love bootstrapping repeatable builds, testing systems, automatic doc generation, etc.  It&#8217;s a reflexive response having seen so many projects that were doomed from the word &#8216;go&#8217; by developers who named folders any old thing.  Even folks that joined the team within the first year were confused as to where code was located and what (if any) naming conventions existed.</p>

<p>Similarly, I&#8217;ve been writing software for millions of users for ten years now and these days I think intensely about architecture when bootstrapping new components or applications.  Making the appropriate trade-offs between short- and long-term design up front will accelerate development while leaving you open to pivoting or scaling when the time is right.</p>

<p>My problem comes to the final touches of a release.  For example, often when I&#8217;m working on a new release of <a href="https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem">fitgem</a> I code up the functionality, write new tests, write inline API documentation as I create new methods, etc.  After I think I&#8217;m done I&#8217;ll take the library for a spin in <a href="http://pry.github.com">Pry</a> and start coding against the new API functions.  Things will go well for awhile and then I&#8217;ll hit a snag where I forgot a parameter or had a typo in the code.  Great! My ad-hoc testing revealed something I hadn&#8217;t included in the unit tests. <strong>AND THEN I RELEASE</strong>.  This is not a good thing, but I often spaz out when I get 95% of the way to finishing, hit a snag, and then fix my issue.  I guess I feel exasperated about how long this thing is taking and then just wig out and push it (WE&#8217;LL DO IT LIVE!)</p>

<p>To be a good finisher I need to slow down and restart my release process (as light as it is!) when I hit problems.  I need to suppress the anxiousness when I hit minor problems before pushing live, go back to the top of my checklist, and start it over.  Doing that on small projects like a gem will instill good mental resistance to spazzing for large, important releases.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I go <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">on campus</a> to do university recruiting, or I&#8217;m in a non-technical social situation where I must explain what I do for a living, I often take great pains to explain what should be a simple thing.  My title in my company is &#8220;Senior Software Engineer&#8221; but I always very precisely call myself a &#8220;software developer,&#8221; &#8220;programmer,&#8221; or &#8220;software nerd.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am uncomfortable specifically with the &#8220;engineer&#8221; label, and that discomfort stems primarily from a panel discussion I attended in conjunction with the <a href="https://ecs.engr.wisc.edu/public/index.php">UW Engineering Career Services</a> group.</p>

<p>For some background, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Computer Science is <em>not</em> part of the School of Engineering, but a department in the School of Letters &amp; Science.  Even so, Computer Science students are given leave to particpate in School of Engineering career fairs and recruiting due to the crossover technical skillset.</p>

<p>As someone who conducts on-campus interviews and attends career fairs for my company at UW I was invited to a panel discussion on &#8220;starting your first engineering job after graduating.&#8221;  It was a fantastic topic for a panel because many seniors are so busy interviewing, wrapping up courses, and thinking about relocation concerns that they often don&#8217;t think much about the actual beginning of a professional career.  Other folks on the panel included chemical engineers, industrial engineers, civil engineers, mechanical engineers and more.</p>

<p>Topics ranged across the board (Do you work a lot of hours? Do you like your boss? Have you been promoted yet?) but one that stuck with me was the question: &#8220;Should I pay/study for my engineer certification? Is it better to do it before interviewing or will my employer fund the cost?&#8221;  Many engineers on the panel had various opinions and it really did vary widely by field, but when it got to me I just shrugged and told the truth: <strong>there is no professional certification to be a software &#8220;engineer&#8221;</strong>.  There are certainly certifications for working with a particular software system, but there is no certification that will allow you to be insured against writing buggy software.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>

<p>I admire engineers and really only want to drive on bridges and use power tools that were designed by professional engineers.  Software developers
CAN produce incredible feats of redundant, bug-free software system design and implementation but with the stipulation that time and process are needed to accomplish such things.  There likely do exist folks with the sufficient experience and knowledge to be called software engineers, but I am not one of them and they are few and far between.</p>

<p>In the tech sphere this is really more of an academic conversation- we all speak the same language.  Everyone at your software company has some flavor of &#8220;engineer&#8221; in their title, and no one thinks twice about it.  When thrust into the larger world of engineers, however, the loosey-goosey nature of software development and it&#8217;s similarity to more of a craft than a discipline make strict adherance to standards of proven technical excellence difficult.</p>

<p>What do you think? Does the typical professional software development environment make you think of &#8220;engineering&#8221; in the same way that mechanical or civil engineers practice it?  Does the fact that we do TDD/BDD make up for the fact that software tends not to have perfectly understood natural laws it must follow?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
    <ol>
        <li id='fn:1'>This argument has indeed been made <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=software+development+is+not+engineering">many times before</a>; this post is more my feelings about it. <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two things forced my hand to move my development blog off of my own Rails-based blogging codebase and onto
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> via <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>My VPS is becoming severely overcrowded with deployed apps; I use it as a testbed for a lot of ideas as well as my <a href="http://www.whazzmaster.com">main swearing-at-pop-culture blog</a> and I didn&#8217;t want to host yet another heavyweight rails app to chew through limited resources.</li>
<li>I reaaally like the &#8216;one-file-per-post&#8217; model of Octopress/Jekyll, and keeping my development blog/presentations right next to my open source code is very appealing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Since I wrote my latest blog engine to take markdown input it was easy-as-pie to export the existing posts to files and then use them to bootstrap this Octopress site.  For now I&#8217;ll ride on the default theme and see how it goes.  I hope to spend more time iterating on my presentations and a bunch of C++ code that I&#8217;m working on for a work project, so it&#8217;s also a plus that I don&#8217;t have maintain the platform source tree anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of development around <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> lately and I&#8217;m really starting to love it.  Specifically, <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">Github-flavored markdown</a> has grown on me with its ability to do easy fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting.</p>

<pre><code>```ruby
comments = Comment.all
```
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
comments = Comment.all
</pre>


<p>When I rewrote the code for this web site awhile back I decided to support markdown, but didn&#8217;t really think I&#8217;d use it much; maybe to do code blocks but not much else.  Now I find myself writing markdown for all content, and only translating it through various interpreters when I need the HTML.  In retrospect I&#8217;m extremely glad I went through the effort to add markdown support for the site&#8211; I use it all the time now.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <strong>incredible</strong> app for writing markdown on the fly: <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> is a Mac application that lets you input markdown on the left pane and the HTML is dynamically updated in the right pane.  I&#8217;m literally using it right now to write this post, just to get a preview of what it will look like when I drop it into the &lt;textarea&gt; on the web site.</p>

<p>I basically use it for all markdown content authoring, and then I copy/paste the result into whatever application/content field I will use it in.  It allows me to do edit/revision cycles on content as well as seeing the application of styles.  Highest recommendation.</p>

<p>I also recently forked <a href="https://github.com/sr/git-wiki">git-wiki</a> and started working on improving it for my own use.  It also uses Markdown to write the wiki entries, which gets a little weird if you&#8217;ve ever used <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> or <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>.  The default way to define <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord">wikiwords</a> in git-wiki didn&#8217;t really work for me so I updated it and checked everything back into <a href="https://github.com/whazzmaster/git-wiki">my own repo</a>.  I&#8217;ll be updating more about my git-wiki fork once I get it refactored and a little more configurable.</p>

<p>So there you go- markdown is awesome and you should write your content in it; if you&#8217;ve never worked with it then try it out on Github (just make a public repo and create a README.md in the index).</p>
