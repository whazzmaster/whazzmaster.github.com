  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I go <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">on campus</a> to do university recruiting, or I&#8217;m in a non-technical social situation where I must explain what I do for a living, I often take great pains to explain what should be a simple thing.  My title in my company is &#8220;Senior Software Engineer&#8221; but I always very precisely call myself a &#8220;software developer,&#8221; &#8220;programmer,&#8221; or &#8220;software nerd.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am uncomfortable specifically with the &#8220;engineer&#8221; label, and that discomfort stems primarily from a panel discussion I attended in conjunction with the <a href="https://ecs.engr.wisc.edu/public/index.php">UW Engineering Career Services</a> group.</p>

<p>For some background, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Computer Science is <em>not</em> part of the School of Engineering, but a department in the School of Letters &amp; Science.  Even so, Computer Science students are given leave to particpate in School of Engineering career fairs and recruiting due to the crossover technical skillset.</p>

<p>As someone who conducts on-campus interviews and attends career fairs for my company at UW I was invited to a panel discussion on &#8220;starting your first engineering job after graduating.&#8221;  It was a fantastic topic for a panel because many seniors are so busy interviewing, wrapping up courses, and thinking about relocation concerns that they often don&#8217;t think much about the actual beginning of a professional career.  Other folks on the panel included chemical engineers, industrial engineers, civil engineers, mechanical engineers and more.</p>

<p>Topics ranged across the board (Do you work a lot of hours? Do you like your boss? Have you been promoted yet?) but one that stuck with me was the question: &#8220;Should I pay/study for my engineer certification? Is it better to do it before interviewing or will my employer fund the cost?&#8221;  Many engineers on the panel had various opinions and it really did vary widely by field, but when it got to me I just shrugged and told the truth: <strong>there is no professional certification to be a software &#8220;engineer&#8221;</strong>.  There are certainly certifications for working with a particular software system, but there is no certification that will allow you to be insured against writing buggy software.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>

<p>I admire engineers and really only want to drive on bridges and use power tools that were designed by professional engineers.  Software developers
CAN produce incredible feats of redundant, bug-free software system design and implementation but with the stipulation that time and process are needed to accomplish such things.  There likely do exist folks with the sufficient experience and knowledge to be called software engineers, but I am not one of them and they are few and far between.</p>

<p>In the tech sphere this is really more of an academic conversation- we all speak the same language.  Everyone at your software company has some flavor of &#8220;engineer&#8221; in their title, and no one thinks twice about it.  When thrust into the larger world of engineers, however, the loosey-goosey nature of software development and it&#8217;s similarity to more of a craft than a discipline make strict adherance to standards of proven technical excellence difficult.</p>

<p>What do you think? Does the typical professional software development environment make you think of &#8220;engineering&#8221; in the same way that mechanical or civil engineers practice it?  Does the fact that we do TDD/BDD make up for the fact that software tends not to have perfectly understood natural laws it must follow?</p>

        <li id='fn:1'>This argument has indeed been made <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=software+development+is+not+engineering">many times before</a>; this post is more my feelings about it. <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>â†©</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two things forced my hand to move my development blog off of my own Rails-based blogging codebase and onto
<a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> via <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>My VPS is becoming severely overcrowded with deployed apps; I use it as a testbed for a lot of ideas as well as my <a href="http://www.whazzmaster.com">main swearing-at-pop-culture blog</a> and I didn&#8217;t want to host yet another heavyweight rails app to chew through limited resources.</li>
<li>I reaaally like the &#8216;one-file-per-post&#8217; model of Octopress/Jekyll, and keeping my development blog/presentations right next to my open source code is very appealing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Since I wrote my latest blog engine to take markdown input it was easy-as-pie to export the existing posts to files and then use them to bootstrap this Octopress site.  For now I&#8217;ll ride on the default theme and see how it goes.  I hope to spend more time iterating on my presentations and a bunch of C++ code that I&#8217;m working on for a work project, so it&#8217;s also a plus that I don&#8217;t have maintain the platform source tree anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of development around <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> lately and I&#8217;m really starting to love it.  Specifically, <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">Github-flavored markdown</a> has grown on me with its ability to do easy fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting.</p>

<pre><code>```ruby
comments = Comment.all
```
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
comments = Comment.all
</pre>


<p>When I rewrote the code for this web site awhile back I decided to support markdown, but didn&#8217;t really think I&#8217;d use it much; maybe to do code blocks but not much else.  Now I find myself writing markdown for all content, and only translating it through various interpreters when I need the HTML.  In retrospect I&#8217;m extremely glad I went through the effort to add markdown support for the site&#8211; I use it all the time now.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an <strong>incredible</strong> app for writing markdown on the fly: <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> is a Mac application that lets you input markdown on the left pane and the HTML is dynamically updated in the right pane.  I&#8217;m literally using it right now to write this post, just to get a preview of what it will look like when I drop it into the &lt;textarea&gt; on the web site.</p>

<p>I basically use it for all markdown content authoring, and then I copy/paste the result into whatever application/content field I will use it in.  It allows me to do edit/revision cycles on content as well as seeing the application of styles.  Highest recommendation.</p>

<p>I also recently forked <a href="https://github.com/sr/git-wiki">git-wiki</a> and started working on improving it for my own use.  It also uses Markdown to write the wiki entries, which gets a little weird if you&#8217;ve ever used <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> or <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>.  The default way to define <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord">wikiwords</a> in git-wiki didn&#8217;t really work for me so I updated it and checked everything back into <a href="https://github.com/whazzmaster/git-wiki">my own repo</a>.  I&#8217;ll be updating more about my git-wiki fork once I get it refactored and a little more configurable.</p>

<p>So there you go- markdown is awesome and you should write your content in it; if you&#8217;ve never worked with it then try it out on Github (just make a public repo and create a README.md in the index).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&#8217;d jot down my current technical reading list.  I tend not to read technical books straight through, but instead I pick up a few at a time and refresh myself on whatever I&#8217;m interested in at the time.  (Full disclosure: these links include my Amazon affiliate code).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596008643/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whazzingcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596008643">Learning Mysql</a><p>Back in 2002 I got my exposure to SQL while doing elemntary PHP programming.  I read a little about MySQL back then, but never really went deep into things such as indexes and optimizations.  Rails obscures a lot of that stuff, but I wanted to be able to optimize efficiently and learn more about the underlying technology. So far this book has been really good at diving down underneath your SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, and DROP actions.</p></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356476/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whazzingcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1934356476">Metaprogramming Ruby</a> <p>This is bar none my favorite Ruby book, and in my opinion is far better than the Pickaxe book for those who are coming to Ruby from another language/ecosystem.  The fellas at <a href="http://www.bendyworks.com">Bendyworks</a> have been doing a bi-weekly book club on this book and I&#8217;ve happily attended as many as I could to talk about it.  This book goes into incredible, understandable detail about the object model and dynamic nature of programming in Ruby.  It gets my highest recommendation.</p></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393979504/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whazzingcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393979504">C Programming: A Modern Approach</a> <p>My college computer science curriculum was in C++ and Java.  My job at <a href="http://www.intuit.com">Intuit</a> involves C/C++/C# development, but it tends to fall heavily into the C++/C# side of things.  I respect the hell out of Zed Shaw&#8217;s outlook on programming, and truly believe that a working knowledge of C development will take you far.  To that end, I&#8217;ve been working through <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn C the Hard Way</a> online while reading this superb book.  I also purchased the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131103628/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whazzingcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0131103628">The C Programming Language</a> book, but A Modern Approach is, in my opinion, superior as a reference and primer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My technical reading list changes often; I&#8217;ll usually read through three books over the course of several weeks and then pull more off my shelf and refresh myself on a different topic.  It&#8217;s why I also buy books on the periphery of my interests just to have them on my shelf.  I enjoy having the references available, even if I don&#8217;t read them as soon as they arrive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve found that many of the truly interesting and outlook-altering pieces of information I&#8217;ve acquired have come via finding something randomly or pseudo-randomly as opposed to searching it out.</p>

<p>These days the information in question is often a tool, configuration, or piece of code that radically shortcuts an oft-repeated activity.  It has nothing to with luck, or ability to use Google, however.  <strong>The delight in finding the perfect tool or option is often that you never conceived that it could exist in the first place</strong>.</p>

<p>The most stark example I&#8217;ve had recently is in pursuit of my quest to <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">learn vim</a>.  In changing over from TextMate to vim many times I would end up pondering really newb questions: how do I cut a line of text? How do I move to the end of a file?  A couple of HI-YAH&#8217;s of Google-Fu later I&#8217;ve got the answer an I&#8217;m trucking along.  Some days, however, I&#8217;ll be reading something unrelated and all of a sudden learn that <strong>dt followed by a character</strong> <em>will delete from the cursor position to the next instance of that character</em>.  It&#8217;s weird, but that was a game-changer for me.  Changing out strings became: <strong>dt&#8221;</strong> and then insert and go.</p>

<p>I could also characterize my use of <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">guard</a> in this way.  I was at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Mad-Railers/">Mad-Railers</a> hack day awhile back and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/listrophy">Brad</a> happened to be using <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec">guard for his rspec execution</a> during TDD.  It was a revelation that I could just edit files and tests and it would automatically rerun.  Here&#8217;s where things get interesting, however.  It had previously never occurred to me to even look for a way to speed up my tests or optimize the time spent manually executing them.  It was a problem I didn&#8217;t know I had.  After learning about guard I looked through <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/List-of-available-Guards">the list of available guards</a>, however, and found some other interesting ones.  These additional plugins for the guard model were also solving problems I didn&#8217;t even know were bugging me until I found they were solved problems.</p>

<p>This all came to me this morning as I was watching Ryan Bates&#8217; <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/285-spork">Railscast on using Spork</a> to speed up test execution further by preloading the Rails framework and keeping it in memory between tests.</p>

<p>When worrying about getting a primary goal completed (say, a feature in an application) you don&#8217;t often think about solutions to one-off problems or annoyances, let alone prioritize solving them.  This is partially why I invest time at the beginning of a project to develop and optimize the code-test-fix cycle, why I obsess over the deployment model when I only have a README, and why I like continuous integration before a test has been written.  Once your process for coding is solid, you can optimize it piecemeal as you <strong>need to</strong> or as you <strong>find unexpected tools or processes</strong> that would increase your productivity drastically.</p>

<p>An example: my tests were already running really well under guard, but 15 minutes or install and configuration of <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-spork">guard-spork</a> I saw immediate speed gains.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In getting the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">paperclip gem</a> working on my server for some screenshots I ran into a frustrating problem.  I kept getting an error during model saving: <strong>&#8220;/tmp/1234bduct-123.png is not recognized by the &#8216;identify&#8217; command&#8221;</strong>.  Eventually I solved the problem, so here is my solution, hoping that it helps someone else out there.</p>

<p>After some googling and reading <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> I quickly came across the solution that Paperclips :command_path option wasn&#8217;t being set correctly.  The problem, however, was that it looked like I was correctly setting the ImageMagick path:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
$ which identify
/usr/local/bin/identify
</pre>


<p>I kept double- and triple-checking that the option was set correctly in my config/environments/staging.rb file:</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
WhazzingCom::Application.configure do
  ....
  Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/local/bin"
end
</pre>


<p>That seemed to be correct, but I still kept getting the same error.  Eventually I came across an <a href="http://blog.e-thang.net/2009/12/30/paperclipimagemagickrmagick-error-is-not-recognized-by-the-identify-command/comment-page-1/#comment-1067">excellent suggestion</a> that perhaps my installed version of ImageMagick was incomplete, corrupt, or missing libs or dependencies.  First I reran the ImageMagick apt-get install&#8230;</p>

<pre lang="bash">
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing
</pre>


<p>&#8230;which installed identify to <strong>/usr/bin</strong> rather than the existing version in <strong>/usr/local/bin</strong>.  I then updated my environment file to the following&#8230;</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
WhazzingCom::Application.configure do
  ....
  Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/bin"
end
</pre>


<p>&#8230;and refreshed the page and everthing worked as expected!</p>
