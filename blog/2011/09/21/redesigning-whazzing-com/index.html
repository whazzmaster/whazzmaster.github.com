<div class="entry-content"><p>For the last month I&#8217;ve been working to create this new development-focused blog and project repository for my work.  I was previously self-hosting a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog, but I&#8217;ve developed a desire to own my destiny when it comes to the display of my work.  There were a ton of little features I wanted to develop but didn&#8217;t really want to delve (back) into the PHP world or hack at the Wordpress template framework.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recently read the excellent <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a> and it made me very excited to design a site that effortlessly works on phones, tablets, monitors, and TVs.  Another project I have in mind is primarily aimed at mobile form factors, so I thought a semi-major experiment was in order to ensure I was thinking in the right direction when it came to media queries and mobile design.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>I built <a href="http://whazzing.com">whazzing.com</a> with ruby 1.9.2, rails 3.1, mysql, and various gems.  My first commit was August 19th, 2011 and I deployed version 1.0 to production on September 20th, 2011.</p>

<p>As I started coding this site, Rails 3.1 was entering it&#8217;s final release candidate testing phase so I decided to start fresh on it.  The asset pipeline is just a terrific addition to the framework, and combining it with the style organization I&#8217;ve been developing off of Dale Sande&#8217;s incredible <a href="http://axle.dalesande.com">Axle framework</a> provided for a <strong>very smooth visual design experience</strong>.  I added a little bit to Dale&#8217;s CSS organization to support the media queries I wanted to support.</p>

<p>One of the interesting takeways from the excellent testing panel at <a href="http://madisonruby.org/schedule">Madison Ruby</a> was that people are divided about the usefulness of <a href="http://cukes.info/">cucumber</a>.  I had always stumbled in wrangling cucumber to be really useful for the applications I was writing and so I decided to eschew its usage this time. I focused instead on getting good coverage via my <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a> controller and model tests.  I found that leaving cucumber aside really streamlined the process and didn&#8217;t leave me eternally feeling like I was losing focus on the functionality I wanted due to the the myriad tests that were demanded by all the tools I was using.</p>

<p>Madison Ruby was a fantastic source of information on how to write better ruby code and rails applications.  In particular, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/j3">Jeff Casimir&#8217;s</a> talk on using view-models and decorators as opposed to helpers in rails was food for thought.  Halfway through implementation on this site I switched over to using <a href="https://github.com/jcasimir/draper">draper</a> for my presentation logic and I <strong>love it</strong>.</p>

<p>Another tool I wanted to test out for this project was <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">git-flow</a>.  At <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon&#8217;s</a> eye-opening Git workshop I increased my git knowledge 10 times, easily.  Going through the underlying structures of git taught me a lot about what&#8217;s really going on during commits, push, and branching, and I wanted to try to formalize the release process of this project a bit more using git-flow&#8217;s branching model.  The result: I loved the structure of the branches, even if this was a one-man project, and will definitely use it on more projects in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve been more and more intrigued by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> since Github and many other sites support it these days.  Instead of pouring time into creating a WYSIWYG editor or trying to drop one in, I instead grabbed the <a href="https://github.com/blog/832-rolling-out-the-redcarpet">Redcarpet</a> gem and simply use markdown to create the posts and project descriptions.  I also use <a href="https://github.com/github/albino">albino</a> and <a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a> for code highlighting.</p>

<h2>Methodology &amp; Features</h2>

<p>The problem I had to overcome this time (and every time I jumpstart a project) is that too often I get bogged down on tangents.  I&#8217;ll get fixated on one unimportant feature or line of code, I&#8217;ll get frustrated that I can&#8217;t get it the way I want, and eventually I won&#8217;t even want to open the text editor due to feelings of dread.  This time I was determined to mercilessly cut features until I had something simple I could get coded and deployed, and then iterate from there.  A few times I almost got bogged down, but forced myself to leave features on the table for future releases so that I could get my high priority functionality into production.</p>

<p>I settled on <strong>four</strong> main features for the first release:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive design</strong> so that the site would look great on regular monitors, phones, and tablets.</li>
<li><strong>A micro-resume</strong> <a href="http://www.whazzing.com/me">viewable here</a> that I could link to from my new business cards and elsewhere</li>
<li><strong>Taggable blog posts</strong> without comments (for now)</li>
<li><strong>A project guide</strong> so that I can link to all my projects in one place, with links to docs and code where appropriate</li>
</ul>


<p>My major feature list for the next release includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> on blog posts (spam-protected and everything!)</li>
<li><strong>RSS feeds</strong> of blog posts</li>
<li><strong>Release tracking</strong> of projects</li>
<li><strong>Rating and ranking</strong> of blog posts</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll also, of course, be correcting anything that shakes out while using it.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to extending this project, while using it as a platform to document the other things I&#8217;m working on.  I would really like to use <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> for some analytics/tracking ideas I have, and I&#8217;m interested in how to tie in <a href="http://akismet.com/">akismet</a> spam-blocking for comments.</p>

<p>The images along the left side don&#8217;t scan well on mobile devices, so I&#8217;m going to look into replacing them in the next release as well.  I like the structure of the site, but the specific details could be tightened a little.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to get a styleguide up and running so that my CSS can be standardized a little.  I tried as much as possible to be OO in my CSS but failed in a few places that I&#8217;d like to clean up.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Many, many thanks to <a href="http://begriffsschrift.com/">Joe Nelson</a>, from whom I shamelessly stole the idea for the micro-resume.  Thanks so much for the idea- it jump-started what became the new site, blog, etc.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to <a href="http://kev.inburke.com/">Kevin Burke</a>. I read his blog post on <a href="http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/site-redesign/">designing your personal site</a> and was inspired to go beyond the usual &#8220;reverse chronological order of posts&#8221; home page.  Instead I tried to create a homepage that advertises all the things I&#8217;m working on, blog posts being only one of the pieces.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.dalesande.com/">Dale Sande</a>, who helped me step up my CSS game with his excellent <a href="http://axle.dalesande.com">Axle framework</a> and thoughts on OOCSS (object-oriented CSS).  If you ever get a chance to attend his OOCSS talk definitely do it; as a primarily backend dude I found it immensely helpful for structuring my CSS and semantic markup.</p>
